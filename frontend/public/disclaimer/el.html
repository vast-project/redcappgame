    <strong>Purpose of the research activity:</strong> To study the moral elements that can be considered as the “common” and “fundamental” values of the European Union; to investigate how the European Values are recognized and perceived in classical texts and folklore (e.g., fairy tales); to understand how the today citizens appropriate of these values; to store and share aggregated data about the appropriation of values by the citizens.
  </li>

    <strong>Description of Action:</strong> we propose to explore an interactive version of the “Little Red Riding Hood” fairy tale. Throughout the story, we propose questions where you can express your feelings about a specific step of the story by choosing between two proposed options. The answer to a question can change the subsequent steps of the story. At the end of the activity, you will be asked to evaluate the experience on a 1-5 scale.
